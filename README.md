## Installing and running

We recommends you to have at least **node v16** to be installed. Once you installed nodejs, clone the repo, then run `npm install` and `npm run build`.

After, configure your settings in [src/config.js](src/config.js). If you wish to consistently pull updates from this repo without the hassle of merging, create `config.js` in the root folder so they override the configs in `src/`.

Finally run the following to start the server: `node src/server.js`
